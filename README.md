This is an app that I wrote to have a greater understanding of Javascript.

It was written using a combination of vanilla Javascript, CSS3, and HTML5 using Window's localStorage API for storing data.

Benefits of using windows localStorage are,
	- more data storage (~5mb) than cookies (~45kb)
	- more secure than using browser
	- does not expire
	- works across different tabs or windows.

Website highlights are as follows:
	- a form to add new entries or edit existing entries stored in the local storage area
	- a table to list all the entries
	- easily add new names to an existing company's employee list
	- sort table cells by selecting the header name and a down or up arrow will indicate the direction the data is sorted.
	- table is scrollable when records number go past screen size
	- table cells expand vertically when data goes past horizontal dimensions
	- when hovering over the form, buttons or table header the view will change
	- created icon for website
